# About This API Documenation 
This is an API Documenation for all the Sass variables that have been defined per module and the utility of each of the variables. This is not the theme documentation but the documentation of the variables itself. 


## Overriding SASS variables 
**Overiding Variables:** The variables that can be overriden have been declared using the `!default` flag in SASS files. Please check the theme documentation on how you can override variables and customized the theme.

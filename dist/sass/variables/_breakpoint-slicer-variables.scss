// Responsive Breakpoints
//
// The WoodPeckerÂ® Theme depends on Bootstrap Grids for layouts. However there are components that are specific to WoodPecker. For those components we use the [Breakpoint Slicer](https://github.com/lolmaus/breakpoint-slicer). following are the breakpoints that we use.
//
// - `xs` = between 0px to 576px
// - `sm` = between 577px to 768px
// - `md` = between 769 to 992px
// - `lg` = between 993px to 1200px
// - `xl` = above 1200px
//

  $slicer-breakpoints:      0      576px      768px       992px       1200px ;
